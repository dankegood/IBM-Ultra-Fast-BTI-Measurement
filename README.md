# IBM-Ultra-Fast-BTI-Measurement
Ultra-Fast BTI (Bias Temperature Instability) stress test measurement using Agilent B1500A and WGFMU (Waveform Generator/Fast Measurement Unit)

Developed both GUI and core test program that controls B1500A/WGFMU testers for Ultra-Fast BTI measurement using C# language

The program is capable of stressing 5 devices in parellel with completely independent stress/measurement combinations, resulting in resulted in a 200x (40 x 5) improvement in the parallel testing efficiency/speed for parameters sweeping
